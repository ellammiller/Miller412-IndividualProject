Version 1 of the Phrase WordPress plugin can solely handle header and content. This will be improved in the next version.

= Can I use the plugin together with Multilang plugins? =
Yes, the plugin can be easily used with Polylang and WPML, as described above. For now, our plugin does not yet work with MultilingualPress, due to the plugin only running in a multisite.
